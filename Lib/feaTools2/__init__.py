"""
To Do:
- get rid of remove glyph and rename glyph for now. the objects need to mature before conveniences are added.
- rername lookup.name to lookup.tag
- get rid of the addLanguageSystem in the writers. it only means something in .fea
  and it can be deduced through iteration.
- support GSUB lookup type 7
- support GPOS
- move type assertions from writer to attributes in the subtable objects
- handle markAttachmentType properly
- revisit __hash__
- zfill class and lookup names?
- should there be any checking for overwrites or bad data? should the objects be responsisble for this?
    - duplicate feature tag
    - existing class
    - duplicate script tag
    - duplicate language tag
    - duplicate lookup name
    - lookup reference to unknown lookup
    - class reference to unknown class
    - target/substitution/backtrack/lookup structure
    - GSUB and GPOS subtables in the same lookup
- add decompress methods that undo what compression does.
  this would be useful for taking .fea or a subset object and going back to binary.
- the ignore support in the remove glyph/should be removed process in the
  GSUB subtable object may be fragile. maybe set a special substitution Ignore value? 
- make a fontTools object writer
- make a compositor object writer
